*Github needs to be updated to include personal work and work from highschool game dev class.

This Github Primarily shows work from **DGM 1610**: Scripting for animation (taken fall 2022), as well as my work from a Game Development class in highschool (that was not concurrent enrollment).

Additionally, I have work from spring of 2021 from a highschool **CS 1400** (Fundamentals of Programming) located here: https://replit.com/@LaurZei 
This class was focused on using Python, two projects I can showcase from that class are pinned on the replit profile, or linked here: 
User interactive escape room: https://replit.com/@LaurZei/escape-room
Python Turtle graphic elements using coding: https://replit.com/@LaurZei/Pumpkin

# DGM1610_UVU Fall 2022
**!! PLEASE READ !! TOTAL COMMITS NOTE:** My github does NOT show all the commits I had made over Fall semester. The reason behind this is due to not having GitIgnore, a setting for Unity projects to only upload scripts and assets, instead of the entire unity project. I ran into this issue a month or so through the semester, my uploads were too large per commit due to unity project libraries. I didn't notice this until more than halfway through the semester, I had no idea about gitignore. 

The repository you are at right now is new, with the GitIgnore setting. 
To see the old repository with the first few commits, it is located here: https://github.com/LaurenZeigler/UVU_DGM1610_Fall2022
