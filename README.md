# DGM1610_UVU


Due to not knowing about GitIgnore to reduce the amount of files when commiting and pushing to github, I was unable to do so for a few months, because pushes were too large. This is a new repository in comparison, so not as many commits can be seen. The first few commits I was able to make in this semester are located in an old repository, here: https://github.com/LaurenZeigler/UVU_DGM1610_Fall2022
