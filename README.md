**!! PLEASE READ !! Note on the total commits:** My github does NOT show all the commits I had made over Fall semester. The reason behind this is due to not having GitIgnore, a setting for Unity projects to only upload scripts and assets, instead of the entire unity project. I ran into this issue a month or so through the semester, my uploads were too large per commit due to unity project libraries. I didn't notice this until more than halfway through the semester, I had no idea about gitignore. 

The repository you are at right now is new, with the GitIgnore setting. 
To see the old repository with the first few commits, it is located here: https://github.com/LaurenZeigler/UVU_DGM1610_Fall2022
